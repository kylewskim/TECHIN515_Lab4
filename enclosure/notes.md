# Enclosure Notes

## Materials & Construction  
The wand enclosure is constructed using a combination of **MDF** and **acrylic**. These materials were chosen to create a structure that is both **modern in appearance** and **easy to disassemble** for maintenance or upgrades. While traditional wands are often perceived as rough, wooden sticks, I wanted this design to reflect a more **sleek and contemporary** aesthetic.

## Design Decisions  
The MDF provides a sturdy framework, while the acrylic panels offer a clean, polished look. The two materials were combined to achieve a balance between **durability and visual refinement**. The enclosure was designed with a dedicated compartment for the **battery**, and internal mounts to **secure both the ESP32 board and the battery** in place during use.

Additionally, both the **USB-C port** and the **power switch** are exposed on the outside of the wand, allowing for easy access without opening the case. This design consideration enhances usability and supports quick charging or power toggling.

Overall, the enclosure supports both **form and function**, serving as a protective housing while contributing to the wandâ€™s modern identity.
